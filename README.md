# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is a reflection of my hands-on learning experience during my MERN Stack training program. Each day, we dive into fundamental frontend concepts such as:

- Writing semantic and accessible HTML  
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS  
- Adding interactivity with vanilla JavaScript  
- Building real-world components and pages  

> Instead of just learning theory, I build mini-projects daily — and this repo documents my daily growth, learnings, and creative implementations.

---

## 🚀 My Learning Philosophy

> 💡 **"Build. Break. Learn. Repeat."**

I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. Here's how I approach my training:

- 🧠 Understand the concept from scratch  
- 🔨 Apply it in a hands-on mini project  
- 📂 Organize it properly in GitHub  
- 🧾 Reflect & improve based on feedback  

Each folder in this repo represents one step in my developer journey.

## 📆 Daily Learning Highlights

🗓️ **Week 1**:  
- Basics of HTML, structure & elements  
- Styling with CSS – Box model, Flexbox  
- JavaScript fundamentals – variables, loops, functions  
- DOM manipulation and event handling  

🔄 **More coming soon...** (updated regularly)
