## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is a reflection of my hands-on learning experience during my MERN Stack training program. Each day, we dive into fundamental frontend concepts such as:

- Writing semantic and accessible HTML  
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS  
- Adding interactivity with vanilla JavaScript  
- Building real-world components and pages  

> Instead of just learning theory, I build mini-projects daily — and this repo documents my daily growth, learnings, and creative implementations.

## 🚀 My Learning Philosophy

> 💡 **"Build. Break. Learn. Repeat."**

I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. Here's how I approach my training:

- 🧠 Understand the concept from scratch  
- 🔨 Apply it in a hands-on mini project  
- 📂 Organize it properly in GitHub  
- 🧾 Reflect & improve based on feedback  

Each folder in this repo represents one step in my developer journey.
